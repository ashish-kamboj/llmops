    "\n",
    "### üö® The Problem\n",
    "MLflow's built-in `Guidelines` scorers are hardcoded to use OpenAI API, which requires an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This creates a dependency on OpenAI's API and pricing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ The Solution\n",
    "We've created **custom LLM scorers** that use Groq API instead. These scorers provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fast Inference**: Use Groq's optimized infrastructure with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` model\n",
    "2. **High Quality**: Maintain the same evaluation quality as OpenAI-based scorers\n",
    "3. **Structured Output**: Provide consistent JSON responses for reliable scoring\n",
    "4. **Robust Error Handling**: Include fallback mechanisms for evaluation failures\n",
    "5. **Cost Efficiency**: Significantly lower costs than OpenAI API calls\n",

    "### üîß Troubleshooting Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **üîë Groq API Key Issues**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Make sure your API key is set correctly\n",
    "export GROQ_API_KEY=\"your-actual-api-key\"\n",
    "# Or set it in the notebook cell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: Authentication errors, \"API key not configured\" messages\n",
    "**Solution**: Verify your API key is valid and properly set as an environment variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **üîó MLflow Connection Issues**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start MLflow server if not running\n",
    "mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --port 5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: Connection refused errors, \"Failed to log span\" warnings\n",
    "**Solution**: Ensure MLflow server is running on the specified port\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **‚è±Ô∏è Evaluation Taking Too Long**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reduce dataset size for faster testing\n",
    "small_dataset = eval_dataset[:3]  # Use only first 3 test cases\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: Long evaluation times, timeout errors\n",
    "**Solution**: Start with smaller datasets for testing, then scale up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **üíæ Memory Issues with Large Datasets**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Process evaluations in batches\n",
    "batch_size = 5\n",
    "for i in range(0, len(eval_dataset), batch_size):\n",
    "    batch = eval_dataset[i:i+batch_size]\n",
    "    mlflow.genai.evaluate(data=batch, predict_fn=predict_fn, scorers=all_scorers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: Memory errors, system slowdown\n",
    "**Solution**: Process evaluations in smaller batches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **üîÑ Prompt Loading Issues**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if prompt exists before loading\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    prompt = mlflow.genai.load_prompt(\"prompts:/qa_prompt@latest\")\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Prompt loading failed: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms**: \"Prompt not found\" errors\n",
    "**Solution**: Ensure prompts are registered before trying to load them\n",
