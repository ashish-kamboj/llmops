      "Seventh letter: 'e' – not 'r'.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think I have it: positions 3, 8, and 9 are 'r's.\n",

      "So, there are three 'r's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I recall that \"strawberry\" has double 'r' at the end, but let me confirm the spelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard spelling of \"strawberry\" is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, that's correct. So, after 'e', it's 'r', then another 'r', then 'y'.\n",

      "So, letters: s, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y.\n",

      "\n",
      "S:1, T:1, R:3, A:1, W:1, B:1, E:1, Y:1. Yes, R appears three times.\n",

      "In \"strawberry\", there are two 'r's together at the end, but that's still two separate 'r's.\n",
      "\n",

      "The question says \"the letter 'r'\", and it's case-sensitive? But in the word \"strawberry\", it's all lowercase, and the question says 'r' in lowercase, so no issue with case. Typically, we don't distinguish case for such counts unless specified.\n",
